Description
This is a simple python program that reads and queries excel files.  Each file is read into a DataFrame and then
summary statistics are produced for each year.  Once produced, the user can then look up the information for an
individual country.

Note
This was developed and tested using Jupyter Notebook.  The pandas library is also required for the program to run.
